Criteria: When the user clicks the "generate code" button, the app asks user about criteria for a randomly generated password based on criteria. The first criteria is the user must enter a number to designate character length between 8 and 128 characters. The code cannot move on without this criteria. 
Next the user must confirm if lower case letters, upper case letters, special characters, and numbers are to be included. If the user does not confirm at least one of these parameters, the code will ask the user to try again. 
Finally, the code will generate a random password based on the parameters set by the user and display that password. 

Method: Some coding was provided. I used class notes, W3 schools, and Stack Overflow (via Google Fu) to complete this assignment. 

Future Work: The script.js file has some areas where reptitive confirms could be added into a function to make the code simplier.
